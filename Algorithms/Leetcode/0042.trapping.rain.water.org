#+title: Trapping Rain Water

* Solution 1: two pointers and max heights on both sides

  Idea is: we can calculate the trapped water at each position i, provided that we know the maximum height from 0 to i-1, and whether there is a block to the
  right that's higher than that at position i. Now if we maintain a max height from both sides, and if they are both higher than position i, we know some water
  can be trapped at position i, the amount is the minimum of the max heights minus the height at i.

  One pointer move from left to right starting at 0, while the other from right to left starting at n - 1.
  We also keep track of max heights the two pointers have seen.
