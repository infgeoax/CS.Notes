#+title: Simplify Path

Given a path starting with '/', simplify it. =.= refers to current directory and =..= refers to the parent directory.

* Stack

  We can use a stack to keep all the path components we've seen so far, and pop the last element if possible when we see =..=, skip =.=, and push new path component.
