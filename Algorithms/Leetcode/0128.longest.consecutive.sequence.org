#+title: Longest Consecutive Sequence

Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.

* Solution: hash set

  If we keep a hashset that contains all elements from the input array, and we can test whether an element is in the set or not in roughly O(1) time.
