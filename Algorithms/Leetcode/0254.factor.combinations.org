#+title: Factor Combinations

Numbers can be regarded as the product of their factors.

For example, 8 = 2 x 2 x 2 = 2 x 4.
Given an integer n, return all possible combinations of its factors. You may return the answer in any order.

Note that the factors should be in the range [2, n - 1].

* Naive solution

  Suppose S(n) is the set of factor combinations for number n, we have the following recursive relationship:

  S(n) = S(n/2)*[2] Union {[2, n/2]} if n is even, that is, for each combination in the set of factor combinations for n/2, add 2 to it.
  Then try 3, 5, 7, ... until it's greater than the square root of n.

  We probably can do memoization to reduce the computation.
