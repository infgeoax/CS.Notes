#+title: Smallest Rectangle Enclosing Black Pixels

Given =mxn= binary matrix where =0= represents a white pixel and =1= a black pixel. Also given the location of one of the black pixels, =x= and =y=
find the area of the smallest rectangle that encloses all the black pxiels.

Time complexity must be less than =O(mn)=.

* Analysis

  To Calculate the area, we need four numbers: (left, top) - (right, bottom)

  - top: minimum of y
  - bottom: maximum of y
  - left: minimum of x
  - right: maximum of x

  - =O(mn)= is easy: DFS/BFS, and update the four numbers along the way.

  - Is there a way to not go through all the nodes?
