#+title: Minimum Height Trees

A tree is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected
by exactly one path. In other words, any connected graph without
simple cycles is a tree.

Given a tree of n nodes labelled from 0 to n - 1, and an array of n -
1 edges where edges[i] = [a_i, b_i] indicates that there is an
undirected edge between the two nodes ai and bi in the tree, you can
choose any node of the tree as the root. When you select a node x as
the root, the result tree has height h. Among all possible rooted
trees, those with minimum height (i.e. min(h)) are called minimum
height trees (MHTs).

Return a list of all MHTs' root labels. You can return the answer in
any order.

The height of a rooted tree is the number of edges on the longest
downward path between the root and a leaf.

* Peeling onion

  If we try every node and calculate it's height, it'll TLE, Time
  complexity is O(n * (n + e)).

  A better approach is to remove the "leaf" nodes repeatedly, where
  leaf nodes are the nodes that has only one neighbour. A corner case
  is when n is 2, we don't want to remove nodes in this case, as both
  of them are the answer.
