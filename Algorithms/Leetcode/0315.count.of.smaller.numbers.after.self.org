#+title: Count of Smaller Numbers After Self

* Analysis

  The problem is basically try to count the frequency of elements in a given range while we add more elements to the set. Similar to range sum where each element is either 1 or 0.

* Binary Indexed Trees

  Efficiently update an element and query prefix sum in O(log(n)) time.

  BIT are represented as an array, each element in the array stores the sum of some elements of the input array.
