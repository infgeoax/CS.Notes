#+title: Bomb Enemy

Given an m x n matrix grid where each cell is either a wall 'W', an enemy 'E' or empty '0', return the maximum enemies you can kill using one bomb. You can only
place the bomb in an empty cell.

The bomb kills all the enemies in the same row and column from the planted point until it hits the wall since it is too strong to be destroyed.

* Solution (prefix sum)

  How many enemies we can kill if we place the bomb at (i, j)? This number is the number of enemies to the four directions: left, right, up and down, until we
  hit a wall or the edge of the grid.

  F(i, j) = L(i, j) + R(i, j) + U(i, j) + D(i, j)
