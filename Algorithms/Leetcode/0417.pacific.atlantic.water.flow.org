#+title: Pacific Atlantic Water Flow

* Analysis (flawed)

  1. The top-right or bottom-left grid can always flow to both oceans.
  2. If one of its neighbour is higher or equal to these two grids, then that grid can flow to both oceans.
  3. BFS/DFS to collect all such grids.

  Problem with the analysis is: it does not consider if a cell that can have paths to both oceans but not ends at the two corners.

  Updated solution: BFS on all the edge cells, use a queue to remember the coordinates (r, c) of cells to process, plus a flag indicating which ocean it flows
  into, note the two corner cells will each have two entries in the queue. We also maintain a grid to remember which oceans each visited cell flows into, using
  bit manipulation to encode the information in an integer.
