#+title: 4Sum II

* Solution: Hashmap

  Divide the arrays into two groups: (nums1, nums2) and (nums3, nums4). For the first group, calculate and save the (sum, number of (i, j)) mapping into a hashmap.
  Then for each pair of numbers in the second group, find whether the negative of their sum is in the hashmap, if yes, add the value to the final answer.
