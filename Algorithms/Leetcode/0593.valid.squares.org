#+title: Valid Squares

* Notes
  Sort the points by x and y lexicographically. And the edges will always be: 0-1, 0-2, 2-3, 1-3. Why? Considering rotation, there are four rotation groups that a
  sqaure can be in.
  1. Square is aligned to x-y axis, and after sorting, the four points will be in the order: 0:top-left, 1:bottom-left, 2:top-right, 3:bottom-right.
  2. Square's diagnal is aligned to x-y axis, or consider the square is centred at (0, 0), then its four points will lay on the X- and Y-axis. The order is:
     0:left, 1:middle-top, 2:middle-bottom, 3: right
  3. Square is rotated less than 45 degrees
  4. Square is rotated more than 45 degrees
  Either way, point 0 is connected to point 1 and 2, and point 3 is also connected to point 1 and 2.

  Remember to check 0-length edges.
