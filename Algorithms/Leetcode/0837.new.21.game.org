#+title: New 21 Game

Alice plays the following game, loosely based on the card game "21".

Alice starts with 0 points and draws numbers while she has less than k
points. During each draw, she gains an integer number of points
randomly from the range [1, maxPts], where maxPts is an integer. Each
draw is independent and the outcomes have equal probabilities.

Alice stops drawing numbers when she gets k or more points.

Return the probability that Alice has n or fewer points.

Answers within 10^-5 of the actual answer are considered accepted.

* Analysis

  When the game stops, alice will have k to k + maxPts - 1 points (inclusive)

  If we calculate the cumulative probability for points 1 to k +
  maxPts - 1, =F(pt)=, which means the probability that alice will
  have at least =pt= points. The probability that alice will have n or
  fewer points is =F(n) - F(k-1)=
