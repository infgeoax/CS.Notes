#+title: Shortest Path Visiting All Nodes

*Be mindful of the problem state space.*

* Description
  You have an undirected, connected graph of n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1. You are given an array graph where graph[i] is a list of all the nodes connected
  with node i by an edge.

  Return the length of the shortest path that visits every node. You may start and stop at any node, you may revisit nodes multiple times, and you may
  reuse edges.

* BFS

  BFS on an "extended" state: node + visited node mask, we also need a "visited" data structure to avoid loops.
