#+title: Max Frequency Stack

Desing a stack-like data structure to push elements to the stack and pop the most frequent element from the stack.

* Solution 1: Priority queue + hashtable

  Hashtable to store each element's frequency and priority queue to order the elements by frequency

  1. push: increment freq of val, push (freq, push_order, val) to the priority
  2. pop: decrement freq of top val

  
* Solution 2: "Stack" of Stacks

  Idea is to keep one stack for each frequency value and when pop, pop the stack on the largest frequency first.
