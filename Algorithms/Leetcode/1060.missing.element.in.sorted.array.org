#+title: Leetcode 1060. Missing Element in Sorted Array

* Intuition
  Given the restrictions, the number of missing element between index
  $i < j$ can be calculated using formula: $nums[j] - nums[i] - j + i$.
  Because

1. The array is sorted and,
2. All elements are unique.

  To get the k-th missing number, we can binary search the missing
  number count (which is non-decreasing according to its definition), and locate the
  smallest index /i/ such that missing number between 0 and i inclusive is greater than or equal to k.

  And the k-th missing element is $nums[i-1] + k - missing(i-1)$
