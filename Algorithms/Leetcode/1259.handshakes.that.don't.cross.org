#+title: Handshakes that Don't Cross

You are given an even number of people numPeople that stand around a circle and each person shakes hands with someone else so that there are numPeople / 2
handshakes total.

Return the number of ways these handshakes could occur such that none of the handshakes cross.

Since the answer could be very large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

* The Recurence and DP

  Let $f(n)$ be the number of non-crossing handshakes for n people:
  0. $f(0) = 1$
  1. $f(2) = 1$
  2. For n > 2, We can reduce the problem by first pick two people to do the handshake, this effectively divide the circle into two parts, where each one must
     have even numbers of people: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, ..., n, f(n) = f(0) * f(n - 2) +  f(2) * f(n-4) + f(4) * f(n-6) + ... + f(n-2) * f(0)
     f(4) = f(0) * f(2) + f(2) * f(0)

* Catalan Number
