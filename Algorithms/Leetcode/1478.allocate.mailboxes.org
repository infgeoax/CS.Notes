#+title: Allocate Mailboxes

* Analysis
  
 1. If k == n, return 0, we can place one mailbox at each house
 2. If we place one mail box between two houses, no matter where it's placed, the total distance from the two houses to the mail box is the
    distance between the two houses.
 3. If we place one mail box between three houses, always place it at the middle house.
 4. If we place one mail box between n houses, place it on an index so that the houses on its left equals the houses on its right. Why?
