#+title: Minimum Cost to Cut a Stick

The cost of one cut is the length of the stick to be cut, the total
cost is the sum of costs of all cuts. When you cut a stick, it will be
split into two smaller sticks (i.e. the sum of their lengths is the
length of the stick before the cut). Please refer to the first example
for a better explanation.
