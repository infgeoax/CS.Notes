#+title: Find Servers That Handled Most Number of Requests

* Note

  1. Ordered set (RB-tree in C++) to keep track of available servers
  2. A priority queue that returns the assignment with least end time first, we pop and add the server back to the available set if the current job's start time
     is not less than the top end time.
  3. To query the available server, find the first element in the set that's greater than or equal to =i%k= where =i= is the job index, if no such server is
     found, e.g. all available server ids are less than =i%k=, use the smallest server id - wrapping around.
  4. *Don't forget to remove the assigned server from available set.*
