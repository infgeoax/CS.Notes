#+title: Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree III

Tree node with parent pointer. Given two nodes, return their lowest common ancestor.

*The blocking part for me is that the nodes can be in different depths, and the solution is obvious when look back: move the deeper node pointer up.*

* Solution: think of them as singly-linked list

  1. Count the length of the node-to-root path for each node.
  2. "Level" the length, i.e. make the the same, move pointers of the longer path if necessary.
  3. Move both pointers together return the node where they meet.
