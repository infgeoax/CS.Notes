#+title: Minimize Deviation in Array

Array of positive integers, can do as many transformations as possible on any element:

1. If it's even, divide by 2
2. If it's odd, multiply by 2

Deviation is defined as the maximum difference between any two elements in the array

Return the minimum deviation the array can have after some transformations.

* Observation

  From the definition, focus the max and min elements and try to reduce the deviation.
  1. If min element is odd, we can multiply it by 2 and reduce the deviation;
  2. Also, if max element is even, we can divide it by 2 and reduce the deviation as well.
  3. Otherwise, we cannot reduce the deviation and have to stop.

* Solution 1: heap

  1. Increase all the odd numbers (multiply by 2), thus we got all even numbers and we can divide by 2 to reduce the maximum element.
  2. For the max value we use a max heap
  3. Use a variable to track the min value: whenever a max value is divided, compare it with the current min value.
