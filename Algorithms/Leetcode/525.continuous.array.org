#+title: Leetcode 525. Contiguous Array

* Description
  Given a binary array nums, return the maximum length of a contiguous subarray with an equal number of 0 and 1.

* Intuition

  If we maintain a count variable that increase 1 when we see 1 and
  decrease 1 when we see 0. The count will show a zig-zag line graph,
  and each downward segment will represent a zero, while upward
  segment a one. More importantly, between two points on the zig-zag
  line that have the same count value, there will be the same number
  of zeros and ones. If we remember the index of the first occurance
  of each count value, and substract it from the index where we see the
  same count, we'll get the length of a contiguous subarray that has
  the same number of zeroes and ones.

* Implementation
  We can either use an array or a hash map to hold the count to index mapping.
