#+title: The C++ Programming Language 4th Edition

* Ch6. Types and Declarations
  1. =size_t=
     
     Defined in header <cstddef>;
     Implementation-defined unsigned integer type;
     Can hold the size in bytes of every object.
     
  2. =ptrdiff_t=

     Defiend in header <cstddef>;
     Hold the result of subtracting two pointers (to get a number of elements)

  3. Alignment*

     On some machines, the bytes used to hold an object must have proper *alignment* for the hardward to access it efficiently.
     This can affect object layouts: structs sometimes contains "holes" to improve alignment.

     The =alignof= returns the alignment of its argument expression.

  4. Type declaration

     1. =char *kings[]= array of pointers to char (prefix binds tighter than postfix)
        =char (*kings)[]= pointer to a char array.

  5. Initialization

     Four syntaxes to use initializer:

     ={}= /list initialization/ does not allow narrowing. e.g. An integer cannot be converted to another integer that cannot hold its value, =char= to =int= is
     ok, but not =int= to =char=. Floating point and integer values cannot be converted to each other.

     #+BEGIN_SRC C++
       X a1 {v}; // Only this style can be used in every context. Except when using together with auto.
       X a2 = {v};
       X a3 = v;
       X a4(v);

       auto z1 {99}; // z1 is an initializer_list<int>
     #+END_SRC

  6. Deducing a Type
     1. =auto= to deduce the type of an object from its initializer.

     2. =decltype= for deducing the type of something that's not a initializer.
        E.g. An operator that adds two matrices of different element type together.
        Note it's using suffix return type syntax =auto f(T, U) -> type=

        #+begin_src C++
          template<class T, class U>
          auto operator+(const Matrix<T>& a, const Matrix<U>& b) -> Matrix<decltype(T{}+U{})>;
        #+end_src

  7. Lvalues and Rvalues
     1. =lvalue=
        : an expression that refres to an object - a contiguous region of memory.

     2. =rvalue=
        : not an lvalue. e.g. temporary value (returned by a function)

     3. Two properties of an object when it comes to addressing, copying and moving:
        1. Has identity (i): program has a name of, pointer to, or reference to the object. So there's a way to determine if two objects are the same, or has the
           object been modified yet.

        2. Movable (m): The object can be moved from.

        3. Three out of four combinations of the two properties are useful in describing the C++ rules:
           - lvalue: i and !m

           - xvalue: i and m (extraordinary/exper only)

           - glvalue: i (generalized lvalue)

           - rvalue: m

           - prvalue: !i and m (pure rvalue)

  8. Object lifetimes
     - /Automatic/: Objects declared in a function, created on definition and destroyed when its name goes out of scope. Usually allocated on stack.

     - /Static/: Objects declared in global or namespace scope and =static= declared in functions or classes. Created once and live until program terminates.

     - /Free store/: Objects created by =new= and destroyed by =delete=. Programmers can control its life time.

     - /Temporary objects/: intermediate results in a computation or an object used to hold a value for a reference to =const= argument.

     - /Thread-local/ objects declared =thread_local=: created when their thread is created and destroyed with the thread.

  9. Type Alias
     - =using= keyword can be used to introduce alias for an existing type:

       #+begin_src c++
       using Pchar = char*;
       // or template alias
       template<typename T>
       using Vector = std::vector<T, My_allocator<T>>;

       Vector<int> nums; // vector using My_allocator<T>.
       #+end_src
